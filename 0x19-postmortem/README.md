Root Cause Analysis:
Upon thorough investigation, the root cause of the outage was identified as a network failure.This incident occurred due to network infrastructure configuration. The network infrastructure was not configured to handle the anticipated traffic load or experienced misconfigurations. This resulted in bottlenecks and congestion, leading to network instability and ultimately causing the failure.

Impact on Users:
The outage resulted in the following impact on users:

•Inability to access accounts and perform banking transactions.
•Disruption of critical financial services, such as balance inquiries, payments, and fund transfers.
•Frustration, inconvenience, and potential financial losses for users relying on the platform for their banking needs.
Mitigation and Resolution:
To mitigate the impact and resolve the outage, the following actions were taken:

•Immediate mobilization of the technical team to identify and address the root cause.
•Application of fixes, patches, or system adjustments to restore service functionality.
•Ongoing communication with users through various channels such as email notifications to provide updates on the progress of the resolution and alternative means of accessing critical banking services.
Preventive Measures:
To prevent similar outages in the future, the following measures were implemented:

•Enhanced monitoring and alerting systems to promptly identify any potential issues.
•Regular system audits and security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen defenses against malicious attacks.
•Implementation of redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and minimize single points of failure.
•Conducting post-incident reviews to continuously improve incident response and recovery processes.
•Network Monitoring and Alerting: Deploy robust network monitoring tools that continuously monitor the network's health and performance. •Set up proactive alerts and notifications to promptly detect anomalies, such as traffic spikes, latency issues, or equipment failures. This allows network administrators to identify and address potential issues before they escalate into full-fledged outages.


Lessons Learned:
This outage served as a learning opportunity, highlighting the need for:

Robust incident response protocols to ensure efficient coordination and resolution.
Transparent and timely communication with users during service disruptions.
Continuous monitoring, testing, and improvement of system reliability and resilience.
